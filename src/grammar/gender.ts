/*

In Spanish, the following parts of speech are affected by gender:

    Nouns
    Adjectives
    Adjectives, Possessive
    Adjectives, Demonstrative
    Articles (definite and indefinite)
    Subject Pronouns

Each of these parts of speech must agree in gender with the noun they modify or accompany.
In Spanish, the gender of a noun determines the form of the corresponding adjective, article, pronoun, etc.
For example, the masculine noun "perro" (dog) takes the masculine form of adjectives, such as "grande" (big),
and the feminine noun "guitarra" (guitar) takes the feminine form of adjectives, such as "roja" (red).
The gender of a noun also affects the form of the corresponding subject pronoun, possessive adjective, and demonstrative adjective.
